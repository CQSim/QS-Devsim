# QSDevsim

This project aims to simulate semiconductor and ferroelectric devices. It is based on the open source semiconductor device simulator DEVSIM. https://www.devsim.org/
If you want to use this, the best python platform is Conda. The necessary library includes numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, sympy and so on.
 The mesh file for 2D simulation is generated by Gmsh. The exported data files could be visualized by Visit form https://www.visitusers.org
 
At present, there are just three example devices. 
The first one is P-N junction diode, which can be used in the teaching of semiconductor courses.
It also can be modified to simulate your own devices according add proper physical models.

The second one is the ferroelectric capacitor with a step-like shape. This work is based on the Miller experimental equations [J. Appl. Phys. 1990, 68, 6463] or Laundao-Ginsberg
If you use this ferroelectric model in research, please cite the following paper:

The third one is a work to analyze traps in organic semiconductors. It can be used in different types of organic devices, like field effect transistors, diodes, and so on.
This is a noncommercial free project because it has been granted with a Chinese patent [Granted No.ï¼šCN 113297818 B]. But it is free for research and personal purposes. 
The theoretical details can be found in this paper: Q. Chen, J. E. Sanchez, D. Lin, Y. Lei, G. Zhu, Organic Electronics 2022, 103, 106464, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgel.2022.106464.
